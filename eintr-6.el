;; 6.3 Exercise with Narrowing
;; ===========================

;; Write a function that will display the first 60 characters of the
;; current buffer, even if you have narrowed the buffer to its latter half
;; so that the first line is inaccessible.  Restore point, mark, and
;; narrowing.  For this exercise, you need to use a whole potpourri of
;; functions, including ‘save-restriction’, ‘widen’, ‘goto-char’,
;; ‘point-min’, ‘message’, and ‘buffer-substring’.

;; (‘buffer-substring’ is a previously unmentioned function you will
;;                     have to investigate yourself; or perhaps you will have to use
;;                     ‘buffer-substring-no-properties’ or ‘filter-buffer-substring’ ..., yet
;;                     other functions.  Text properties are a feature otherwise not
;;                     discussed here.  *Note Text Properties: (elisp)Text Properties.)

;; Additionally, do you really need ‘goto-char’ or ‘point-min’?  Or can
;; you write the function without them?

;;; Code:

(defun my/first-60-chars ()
  "Return the first 60 characters of the current buffer.
Ignore narrowing."
  (interactive)
  (save-restriction
    (widen)
    (save-excursion
      (message (buffer-substring-no-properties 1 61))))
  )

;;; eintr-6.el ends here
